1. Parser generators that automatically produce syntax analyzers from a grammatical description of a programming language.
2. Scanner generators that produce lexical analyzers from a regular-expression description of the tokens of a language.
3. Syntax-directed translation engines that produce collections of routines for walking a parse tree and generating intermediate code.
4. Code-generator generators that produce a code generator from a collection of rules for translating each operation of the intermediate language into the machine language for a target machine.
5. Data-flow analysis engines that facilitate the gathering of information about how values are transmitted from one part of a program to each other part. Data-flow analysis is a key part of code optimization.
6. Compiler-construction toolkits that provide an integrated set of routines for constructing various phases of a compiler.
